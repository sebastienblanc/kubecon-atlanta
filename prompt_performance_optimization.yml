    # Performance Optimization Analysis
    
    Analyze the following system/application for performance optimization opportunities:
    
    **System**: {{system_name}}
    **Performance Baseline**: {{current_performance}}
    **Target Goals**: {{performance_goals}}
    **Environment**: {{environment_details}}
    
    ## Current Implementation:
    ```
    {{current_implementation}}
    ```
    
    ## Performance Metrics:
    ```
    {{performance_metrics}}
    ```
    
    ## Load Patterns:
    {{load_patterns}}
